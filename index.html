      <h2> About Our Project </h2>
      <p>
        This project explores how technology can be used to promote diversity and inclusivity.
        Our tagline <strong> "Code the Future. Include Everyone." </strong>, aim to
        inspire others to see technology not only as innovation, but also as a tool for equity 
        and social good. Through this website, we share our ideas and resources such as the Implicit Bias 
        Test and intersectionality as well as our tech heroes that create the awareness through
        digital empowerment.
